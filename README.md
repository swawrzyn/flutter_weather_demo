# flutter_weather

A new Flutter project to help me get my feet wet in the framework and dart. Will follow Clean Architecture principles and TDD throughout. Will also shamelessly follow [Reso Coder's tutorial](https://resocoder.com/category/tutorials/flutter/tdd-clean-architecture/) while mixing up the content a bit to make it interesting.
